## Exercise 1 
### 1.1 perform Minimax search on the tree, i.e., annotate all internal nodes with the correct Minimax values

### 1.2 Which moves does max choose
7->8 through the middle branch gives the highest result 
### 1.3 what can you say about the utility he will receive against:
#### 1.3.1 An optimally playing opponent
if he plays against an optimal opponent he would get the utility from [[#1.2 Which moves does max choose]] 
### 1.3.2 A non-optimally playing opponent
if he plays against an non-optimal opponent he could choose the rightmost branch and receive a utility up-to 11 

## Exercise 2 

## 2.1 Finish the full Minimax tree and annotate each node with its utility

consider the coordinates 0-2 for rows and 0-2 for columns, so X01 is an x in row 0 column 1.
