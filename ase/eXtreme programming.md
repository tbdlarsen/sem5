extreme programming (XP) is a well-known agile method;
it emphasizes collaboration, quick and early software creation, and skillful development practices. It is founded on four values; communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. In addition to Incremental and iterative development (IID), it recommends 12 core practices; 


# Core practices

- **Planning game**:
	- Defining the scope of the next operational release, with maximum value (to the customer) software. Typically a half-day/one-day session, where customer(s) write _story cards_ to describe desired features and the developers then estimate them, using tools like _planning poker_. There may also exist story cards from prior exploration phases work. The customer then chooses what should be in the next release by either setting a date and adding card until the estimate total matches the available time or choosing cards and calculate the release date based on their estimates.
* **small, frequent releases:**
	* releasing versions of the product frequently, not applicable to all projects, and is strictly different than organizing one release cycle into many short iterations, like a sprint. 
* **System metaphors:**
	* to help with design communication, the overall structure of the system or subsystems are described with metaphors. e.x. the C3 payroll system was described in terms of an assembly line of checks with posting rule "machines" operation on them, extracting money from different "bins". This is done so every party involved have the same idea of the system.
* **Simple design:**
	* Avoid speculative design for possible future changes. Avoid creating generalized components that are not immediately required. The design should avoid duplicate code, have a relatively minimal set of classes and methods, and be easily comprehensible.
