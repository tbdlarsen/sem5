**Assignment 1: Exploration of problems (20%)**

Discuss 2-3 cases of IT projects that you know either directly or from the news. Address the questions:

- How was the outcome of the IT project a success and/or a failure?
- What are the reasons given?
- How do you know this?
- In which ways can good/bad software engineering practices be attributed to the success/failure?



### MIT ID

- How was the outcome of the IT project a success and/or a failure?
	- Lowered maintenance 
	- Ease of use
- What are the reasons given?
	- Digitization of identification
- How do you know this?
	- No need to order new key cards
	- cannot throw key cards away
- In which ways can good/bad software engineering practices be attributed to the success/failure?
	- Leveraged the success of Nem-ID, making reuse of existing code.

### Concord video game

- How was the outcome of the IT project a success and/or a failure?
	- The game failed to accumulate a player base
- What are the reasons given?
	- 
- How do you know this?
	- The game was shut down 2 weeks after release
- In which ways can good/bad software engineering practices be attributed to the success/failure?
	- Lack of prototyping, this would have revealed problems with the game




**Assignment 2: Differences between main processes (40%)**

Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the three main processes described in Sommerville's chapter 2. Document your understanding in the table below by filling out the table where the columns are labeled "Benefits" and "Drawbacks," and the rows are labeled "Waterfall development," "Incremental development," and "Integration & configuration."Â 

Then, discuss how these differences can be used in choosing an appropriate process given different situations and circumstances.


| Model                       | Benefits                                                       | Drawbacks                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waterfall                   | Works well when project can be planned ahead.                  | Difficulties adjusting to change,<br>Plan-based meaning the project has to be planned ahead                                                                                |
| Iterative/incremental       | Quick feedback due to initial project.<br>High adaptability    | Feedback loops may differ causing either stillness or over demand. Release frequency may impact overall structure decreasing with process length due to cost effectiveness |
| Integration & Configuration | Can work well, if one big project only it has to be maintained | Compared to stand-alone products the big product may require maintenance in many different areas.                                                                          |
