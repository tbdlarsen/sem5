scrum - a small group responsible for picking up the ball and moving it towards the goal (rugby example)

scrum core concepts
values: commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage
separates two concerns
in what sequence will work be done (PO)
how much work will we commit to (team)
transparency 
the emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work 
inspect and adapt
more focus on goal/results than estimation precision or original plan

be sure to see scrum model - inspect and adapt based on transparency 

(see slides on scrum roles)
roles and tracks
product owner (po)
- prepare backlog
scrum master
- execute and make things
Team
- 





critiques - some may dislike daily  stand up, hard to make backlog if product is unknown/ no PO, Technical debt, requires commitment from all parties involved, incoming urgent tasks may delay sprint backlog, conflicts may occur in sprint retrospective.
