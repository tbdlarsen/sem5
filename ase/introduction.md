### Reasons for software failures
* Increasing demands
	* Faster development
	* Larger and more complex products
* Low expectations
	* Lack of software medthods and techniques
	Causes more expensive and less reliable software.
	Can be fixed by better education and training.


### Software development
* Target group
	* Professional rather than individual
* Not only coding but also all associated documentation and configuration data, (guides, etc).

For more info on what software engineering is refer to figure 1.1

There are two kinds of software product;
* Generic products
	stand-alone systems developed by an organization and open to the market (not nessecarily open-source) e.g. word processors, drawing packages, project management tools etc.
* Customized (bespoke) products 
	Products commisioned by a particular customer. e.g. systems to support a particular business
The main difference between the two is that in generic products the organization that developes the product controls the software specification, and the customer adapts it and vice versa for bespoke products.
Although it is becomming more usual to blur these two e.g. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems such as SAP are an example of this, where the large complex system is adapted by the company be incorporating its business rules and processes etc.

Software development is not only the code but also how the developer makes the program available for the costumer, the characteristics can be boiled down to categories shown in Figure 1.2





### Software engineering
The definition of software engineering includes two key phrases:
* Engineering dicipline
	looking for solutions within financial and organizational constraints and applying theories, methods and tools where they are appropriate to make the solutions.
* All aspects of software production
	Sofware engineering is concerned with technical processes of software development along with project management and the development of tools, methods and theories to support software production.
a large part of software engineering is choosing the best compromise within a given time frame to produce a product that meets the required quality.

software engineering is important for two reasons;
* We rely on andvanced software and we need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly
* It is usually cheaper, compared to running is as if it was a personal project. 

the systematic approach to sofware engineering is usually called a software process.
this comprises four fundamental activities;
* Software specification
	Customers and engineers define the software and constraints.
* Software development
	Designing and programming the software.
* Sofware validation
	Checking software to ensure customers needs are met.
* Software evolution
	software is modified to reflect changung customer and market requirements.

Software engineering is related to both computer science and system engineering, where comp Sci is theory based and system engineering is more concerned with all aspects of software engineering.

There are three general issues that affect many different types of software:
* Heterogeneity, diverse systems, 
	Software has to apply across networks in distributed systems so it has to be compatible with legacy systems along with newer ones, and across operating systems etc.
* Business and social change
	Business and social changes fast, so software has to be able to evolve along with it.
* Security and trust
	Security is very important especially in web services.

These issues are non-independent meaning more than one can apply to a single piece of software


### Software engineering diversity
There exists no one-fits-all method to software engineering, it is largely dependent on what type of software is being developed. 
Among these types of applications are;
* Stand-alone appliations
* Interactive transaction-based applications
* embedded control systems
* Batch processing systems
* Entertainment systems
* Systems for modeling and simulation
* Data collection systems
* System of systems

It is important to note that these are not set-in-stone categories and systems may require some aspects from one category along with others.
All systems should adhere to the methods of figure 1.2.
