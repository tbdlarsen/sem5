The core principles of scrum. To read more about agility see the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) along with the principles of the [agile manifesto.](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

###### Values
The five main values of scrum are;
- Commitment 
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect 
- Courage
###### Scrum Members
There are three important members/groups of scrum to separate the two concerns; The sequence of the work (PO), and the amount of work to commit to (team).
- **Scrum Team** 
	- Cross-functional, seven people +/- 2. 
	- Selects the sprint goal and specifies work results.
	- Has the right to do everything within  the boundaries of the project guidelines to reach the iteration goal.
	- Organizes itself and its work.
	- Demos work results to product owner.
* **Scrum Master**
	* Ensures that the scrum process is followed.
	* Enables close cooperation across all roles and functions.
	* Removes barriers.
	* Shields the team from external interference.
	* Strictly different than PO
- **Product owner (PO)**
	- Accepts or rejects work results.
	- Responsible for vision and profitability of the product
	- Defines the features of the product, decides on release date and content - release planning.

###### Inspect and adapt based on transparency
Scrum focuses on transparency meaning that emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. Along with Inspect ability and adaptability meaning there is more focus on the goal/result itself than the estimation precision or the original plan.

###### Core concepts

| Concept                                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development team                        | A self organizing group of software developers, which should consist of 7 +/- 2 members. They are responsible for developing the software and other essential project documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Potentially ship-able product increment | The software increment that is delivered from a sprint. The idea is that this should be 'potentially ship-able' which means that it is in a finished state and no further work, such as testing, is needed to incorporate it into the final product. In practice, this is not always achievable                                                                                  |
| Product backlog                         | To do list for the scrum team. This may include feature definitions for the software, software requirements, user stories or descriptions of supplementary tasks that are needed such as architecture definition or user documentation.                                                                                                                                          |
| Product owner (PO)                      | An individual (or small group) whose job is to identify product features or requirements, prioritize these for development and continuously review the product backlog to ensure that the project continues to meet critical business needs. The  Product Owner can be a customer but might also be a product manager in a software company or other stakeholder representative. |
| Daily scrum                             | Daily meeting of the scrum team that reviews progress and prioritizes work to be done that day. Ideally, this should be a short face-to-face meeting that includes the whole team. key points are; previous days work, work to be done today, any discovered difficulties.                                                                                                       |
| Scrum master                            | Responsible for ensuring that the scrum process is followed and guides the team in the effective use of scrum. Should not be though of as the product manager                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Sprint                                  | Development iteration, usually 2-4 weeks. Ends with a sprint review of work that meets the DONE criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Velocity                                | An estimate of how much product backlog effort that a team can cover in a single sprint. Understanding a team's velocity helps them estimate what can be covered in a sprint and provides a basis for measuring improving performance.                                                                                                                                           |
