##### Artificial intelligence
The field that studies the synthesis and analysis of computational [[Agent|agents]] that act intelligently.
###### Artificial vs Natural intelligence
Although there is no such thing as _fake_ artificial intelligence, the split between natural and artificial intelligence is that, artificial is human-made and natural is nature made. Intelligence is defined by external behavior, like the Turing test.

###### Scientific goal
The central scientific goal of AI is to understand the principles take make intelligent behavior possible in natural or artificial systems. This is done by;
* The analysis of natural and artificial agents.
* Formulating and testing hypotheses about what it takes to construct intelligent agents.
* Designing, building, and experimenting with computational systems that perform tasks commonly viewed as requiring intelligence.
The systems to test these hypotheses and designs are called **Empirical systems**.  Is not  the intent to reach intelligent thought, but to have thought that affect actions and lead to more intelligent behavior. The goal of AI research is not general intelligence. It is to augment human intelligence and creativity (make better), known as **Intelligence augmentation**, i.e. helping with tasks. Often AI systems are human-in-the-loop meaning AI is working along with humans to advice or give feedback.
###### Engineering goal
contrary to the [[#Scientific goal]] the engineering goal is the design and synthesis of agents that act intelligently, which leads to useful artifacts.
###### Agent
An agent is something that acts in an environment. It is judged solely by how it acts. Agents that have the same effect are equally good. Agents are bound by a specialized domain, has finite memory, and in practice has limited time constraint, meaning no AI is omniscient or omnipotent, knows everything and can do everything respectively.
###### Intelligence
the aspects that go into acting intelligently include;
* What it does is appropriate for its circumstances, its goals and its perceptual and computational limitations.
* It takes into account the short- and long-term consequences of its actions, including the effect on society and the environment.
* It learns from experience
* It is flexible to changing environments and changing goals.

###### Computational agent
an [[Agent]] whose decisions about its actions can be explained in terms of computation, meaning its decision can be broken down to primitive operations that can be implemented on a physical device.
